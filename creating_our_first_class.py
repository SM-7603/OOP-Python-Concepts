# Keep this in mind: creating the instance == creating an object


# 1st part: Create the class

class Item:
    pass # this is just to avoid errors for now

# create the instance of the class
item1 = Item()


# # this example below is equivalent to creating an instance of a class {above} (in this case the class is <str>)
# random_str = str(4)
# print(type(random_str))



# 2nd part: Create the instance of the class
